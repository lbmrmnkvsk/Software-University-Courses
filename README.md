I have completed a total of 14 Software Engineering courses at Software University ([SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/)) and I have solved the problems given as exercises for each course. My project for the course Spring Advanced is a clone of the Amazon Kindle Store which you can find in [this repository](https://github.com/lubomir-m/Amazon-Kindle-Store).
